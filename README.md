##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

1. Their principall points which are handled
in this Booke: viz.

1. AN
ADVERTISEMENT
to the Chriſtian Reader.

#####Body#####

1. Their firſt point. That God did predeſtinate all men to be ſaued, vpon
condition that they repent, and beleeue the Goſpell.

1. Their ſecond point. That God did not elect before all time, to grace and life,
any particular perſons; but in time he doth elect qualities, as
faith and obedience, and then finding theſe qualities in men,
he doth elect their perſons for the qualities ſake.

1. Their third point is: That all men haue free will in themſelues, as well
to repent of their ſinnes, to beleeue the Goſpell and obtaine
ſaluation, as they haue to remaine in hardneſſe of heart and
vnbeliefe, and in the eſtate of damnation.

1. Their fourth point is: That the ſtedfaſtneſſe of mans iuſtification and ſaluation
doth depend vpon his owne will, in continuing in the act of beleeuing
and works of righteouſneſſe; and that ſuch as haue
faith in Chriſt Ieſus, regenerate perſons hauing their names
written in the book of life, may fall away from all, may become
vnregenerate, and haue their names raſed out of the booke

of life againe, and periſh: and that God doth alter and change
his purpoſe and promiſe, and come to hate and reiect ſuch as he
hath formerly loued and iuſtified.

1. Their fift point. That there is no Originall ſinne, but that all children of
all maner of people in the world, as well heathens, Infidels,
Idolaters, worſhippers of Diuels, all kind of blaſphemers, fornicators,
& vncleane perſons whatſoeuer, (as of the faithfull)
are free from all pollution of ſinne, both in the conception and
birth; and dying before they commit actuall ſinnes, are ſaued.

1. Their ſixt point. That none ought to be baptized but ſuch men and women
of yeares onely, as haue attained to true repentance and iuſtifying
faith, being both in the account of the Church and in
the ſight of God regenerate perſons: and that the baptiſme of
children vſed, is no baptiſme at all, but is the marke of the
Beaſt ſpoken of in Reuelat. 13.

1. Their ſeuenth point.
That Church of England is a falſe Antichriſtian
Church, and ought to be ſeperated from.That it is falſe, and Antichriſtian, we proue thus.That the Church whoſe Biſhop and Miniſters, haue had
their firſt ordination from the falſe Antichriſtian Church of
Rome, whereof Antichriſt is the head, is falſe and Antichriſtian.But the Church of England, her Biſhops, and Miniſters,
haue had their firſt ordination from the falſe Antichriſtian
Church of Rome, whereof Antichriſt is the head.Therefore the Church of England, is a falſe Antichriſtian
Church.That it ought therefore to be ſeperated from, we
proue thus.If euery falſe Antichriſtian Church ought to be ſeperated
from, then the Church of England ought to be ſeperated from,
becauſe ſhe is falſe and Antichriſtian, as before is proued.But euery falſe and Antichristian Church, ought to be ſeperated
from, as Reu. 18. 4. Come out of her my people. &c.Therefore the Church of England ought to be ſeperated
from.

1. An eight point,
held at this preſent by the antient Anabaptiſts. That a King or Maieſtrate cannot be a true Chriſtian,
except he giue ouer his kingly office or Maieſtracie.
